## Overview

A coffee display page, built with frontend library react components and hooks like useState & useEffect, page routing, fetching and calling API from a public source.  
The Components are designed to be reuseable.


### The task

- Created a reuseable Card component
- Attacted to the Card component is a picture, name, pricing, rating and number of votes if it exist
- Avalability status were rendered conditionally 
- Fetched and rendered coffee list data from a Public source
- Design adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes
- Cool scale effect was attached to the image on hover
- Toggle between the popular and avalable pages using Link & useLocation from react-router-dom

### Continued development

The project exposed me to working with react concepts like components, props, page routing, useState and useEffect, fething and rendering data. There's need to restructure my use of useEffect hook to dynamically render the fetched coffee listing data for both the AllProduct and Available to KEEP IT DRY. Finding a more efficient way to achieve this will be great and any suggestion to this effect will be greatly appreciated
