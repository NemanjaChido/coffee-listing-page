## Overview

This product display page is built using React, leveraging core concepts such as components, props, and the useState hook. Each product is rendered as a reusable component, receiving its data through props for flexibility. The useState hook manages dynamic UI states, such as toggling the Menu icon for smaller screen sizes. This approach ensures a modular, maintainable, and interactive


### The task

### Continued development

My very first react stuff to be published on my github page. Basically i enjoyed the fact i was able to implement some react hooks like Component, props and useState, to render every section of this product page that adjust to all screen sizes. I feel quite excited exploring React more while i learn. Lastly, as always, i'll always look forward to ideas, suggestions on how better to build with stuff with React.
